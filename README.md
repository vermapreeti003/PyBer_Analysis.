## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the project was to analyze data for a ridesharing company called PyBer to calculate metrics related to the total weekly fares for each city type the rideshare company operates in. Datasets containing ride and city data were used to calculate metrics such as total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver for each of the respective city types.The Data sets were also used to create a new data frame to find the average fare per week for each of the city types. The dataframe from the analysis was used to create a multiple-line graph that visualized the total weekly fares for each city type for the before mentioned period. The metrics and visualization created was then analyzed to provide recommendations to the CEO of Pyber to address any disparities among the city types.

## Results
The following key metrics were calculated and a dataframe was created to observe and analyze some disparities in city types.

From this dataframe we can see that Urban cities have the most amount of rides and drivers and rural cities have the least. As a result the city type Urban brings the most revenue as we can see in the Total Fares column and rural cities bring the least amount of revenue. However, as we analyze the Average Fare per Ride column of this dataframe we can see that Rural city types have the highest average fare per ride, meaning that there is a chance of more revenue in this city type for every ride increase compared to Urban city types wich has the lowest average fare per ride. Other metric that we can see in this dataframe is the average fare per driver, from this data it can be seen that drivers in the rural city type make $55.49 per ride, whereas the drivers in urban areas make almost 4 times less per ride which is $16.58.

A multiple line chart was also created as follows as part of the analysis to help us visualize and perform analysis of the Total Fares for each of the city types.

In this time period analyzed for the total fare for each of the ciy types we can quickly oberve that Urban city types had the highest total fares for all the weeks and rural areas had the least. We can also observe that the 3rd week of February has the highest total fares for each of the city type showing increased demand at that time. Urban cities aslo seem to bring a lot of revenue in the first and third week of March. Towards the start of January 2019 and towards the end of April all Fares for each city type are showling decline.

## Summary
For our analysis of the results after calculating various metrics for each of the city types, here are the recommendtions for addressing any disparities among the cty types:

* Urban cities have the highest total fare and most amount of rides and therefore account for most of the revenue for the company. As a result this is the best performing city type and more investments should be continued to be made in this type to realize greater profits for PyBer in the future.
* Rural cities account for the least amount of rides and the least amount of fares among all the types, however average fare per ride is the highest for this city type, therefore increase in just a bit of ridership in this city type could increase a lot of revenue. Although, it has the least amount of drivers, average fare per driver is the highest for this city type, therefore if ridership can be increased through investment in marketting and other avenues, then it could be easier to get drivers in this particular city type.
* The suburban city type is the middle performing city type in all the metrics calculated, therefore more investments can be directed towards Urban and Rural city types, as this city type can continue and perform as it is doing currently for PyBer.
